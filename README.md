### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - List the industries or roles you have researched:
          * Junior Front-end developer jobs
          * Javascript developer jobs
          * Full Stack developer jobs

    - Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - The javascript developer jobs and full stack developer jobs align more with the interest that I have and also with the skill's I have and will acquire over the duration of this year by completing the software developement bootcamp by codespace and also with the learning I will do over the year. From the companies with job post I have seen, most companies align with my values where team work and growth is valued.
  
      
    - I have noticed different companies have different requirement's for backend development in regards to full stack developer jobs and also the fact that for most junior developer job's the is still a need to have knowledge of more than one language which in my case it is javascript. So I will do more research on the roles available for front-end developer for now and work my way up to full-stack. 

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - Goal 1:
      * Land a job as a Junior Front end developer.
      * By completing my Bootcamp for software engineer and working on multiple side project's which showcase my skill's and knowledge.
      * Work on gaining multiple interviews, which will help me improve my chances of landing a role as a front-end developer.
      * This goal is to allow me to gain working experience in the industry after learning the theory and paradigms and showcasing my skills in my own project's.
      * The goal to land a role should be achieved by no later than next year March, the milestones of completing my bootcamp should be by the end of this year and side project should be complete every two weeks to a month.
     
    - Goal 2:
        * Learn a language which will help me be good at other languages such as C.
        * By completing CS50 introduction to computer science and learning indepth about building project's with C language.
        * By completing each week's challenges, including the harder challenges which will improve my proficiency.
        * This goal will allow me to have a better learning curve for languages such as C++ and C#
        * This goal should be achieved by the end of September.




    - The reason for goal one, is to push my self to be job ready by the end of my bootcamp, ensuring I utilize my free time better to put in the effort required to learn and improve on my skills and work on making my profile standout for recruiters and potential employers. The ambition of this goal is to not just set out to complete this bootcamp but to actually strike to be employerable by no later than the middle of  next year.
    - The reason for goal two, is to increase my proficiency in multiple language's as I have seen how it is an added benefit for applying for job's, which in most cases vary with requirement's from company to company. By learning C, I am certain I will find learning other languages as not as hard as I have found it to learn a new language such as C.
  
      
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - My long term aspirations is to work as a full stack developer in a company and keep building on my technology skills and professional skill's to eventually build up on experience and qualify to a higher role from being just a junior developer. The aim is to grow into a person who can in the future lead my own team for a project as a senior developer.
      
    - This align's with my interest, because as a senior with both skill's with front-end and backend you can even manage a team in a start-up company in a way that you could manage a project with both a front end-team and back-end team's.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Complete CodeSpace Software development bootcamp.
    - Complete all the project's provided by Codespace.
    - Work on having a monthly project highlighting the skills I have acquired from that month and previous months.
    - Complete additional courses from FreeCodeCamp and get the certificates.
    - Have a portfolio made with my best project's from the year.
    - Complete the weekly project's from CS50

          * DevChallenges
          *FreeCodeCamp
          *Edx
      
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Build expertise for backend-developement since I would have experience working with front-end development.
    - Build website and app's which work with back-end to build more project's for my portfolio.
    - Build work experience as a full-stack developer.
    - Keep upskilling by building on more soft skills.
    
    - Build skill's such as node.js, C# or PHP for back-end.
    - Have a cloud service certificate either AWS or Azure.
    - More work experience as either a front-end or full-stack developer.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Possible obstacle's I can anticipate facing is not having a good enough portfolio to attract enough recruiter's in time to reach my first goal in time, the other thing might be having a longer time frame to actually grasp the skills required to build dynamic project's utilising a new language which I will be learning.
    - Use youtube to improve my learning curve, using leetcode to test's my knowledge and find project's to work on from sites such as devChallenges
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Finding open-source project's which i know can work on to implement the skill's and problem solving skill's I have. Attending hackerthons which I can have access to and find workshops which I can attend. 
    - I would also use educational site's which provide certificates for completion to skill up and attend webinars for networking too.
